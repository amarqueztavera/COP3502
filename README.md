Projects from Computer Science 1 - Spring 2023

This class forged my skills in the C language with complicated assignments where I had to utilitize my creativity. Overall a very fun course that I would gladly take again.

This course specifically helped me practice for the Computer Science Foundational Exam at the University of Central Florida, which I passed after my first try.
